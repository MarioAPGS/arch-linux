# Console

I will use kitty as default console, this console consume GPU instead CPU which makes it much more powerful (same for Alacrity console but is less configurable).

Zsh is an improved bash shell, it has spell checking, cd automation, better theme and plugin compatibility etc.

## Installation
```bash
sudo pacman -S zsh kitty
```
chsh -s /bin/zsh

## Configuration
### zsh
- Default zsh config file - `~/.zshrc`
